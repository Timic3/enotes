# ENotes

## Purpose
In everyday life we find ourselves in distress where we don't have access to a pen and paper in order to write down an important date, event, notes, etc. Additionally, regular notes do not warn us about reminders and they may take a lot of space. They can also easily get lost and forgotten.

## System
Android and web applications communicate through API (/backend), which is hosted on Azure, while web application is hosted on Vercel. User has to register and login before they can use applications. After that, backend sends back JWT token, which user can use to represent their integrity within the system.
